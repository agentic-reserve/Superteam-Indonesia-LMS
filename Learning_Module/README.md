# Solana Learning Module

Welcome to the comprehensive Solana Learning Module - a structured educational resource designed to take you from blockchain basics to advanced Solana development across multiple specializations.

## Overview

This learning module organizes content from leading Solana repositories into a progressive curriculum covering:

- **Rust Basics**: Essential Rust programming concepts for Solana development
- **Basics**: Fundamental Solana concepts (accounts, programs, transactions, tokens, PDAs)
- **Security**: Auditing, vulnerability detection, fuzzing, and post-quantum cryptography
- **Mobile**: Mobile wallet integration and dApp development
- **DeFi**: Token economics, AMMs, perpetual futures, and risk engines
- **AI Agents**: Autonomous agent development with Solana integration
- **DePIN**: Decentralized Physical Infrastructure and IoT integration
- **Privacy**: Zero-knowledge proofs, compression, and confidential transactions
