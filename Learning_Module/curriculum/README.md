# Solana Learning Curriculum

Welcome to the Solana Learning Curriculum! This structured learning system guides you from beginner to advanced Solana development through carefully organized content and specialized learning paths.

## Overview

The curriculum is organized into three progressive levels, each building upon the previous:

- **Beginner**: Foundation concepts including accounts, transactions, tokens, and basic program development
- **Intermediate**: Security practices, mobile development, and DePIN/IoT integration
- **Advanced**: DeFi protocols, AI agents, privacy features, and post-quantum cryptography

## Curriculum Levels

### [Beginner Level](./beginner/README.md)
Start here if you're new to Solana or blockchain development. Learn the fundamental concepts that form the foundation of all Solana applications.
